# CbWatchlistAutomation
Adds automated response actions to Cb Response based on Watchlist names

While this script is running watchlist hits in Cb Response will trigger a response based on their names.  3 response actions are possible: ban a hash, isolate a host, and both.  To act, edit a watchlist name to begin with BAN:, ISOLATE:, or LOCK:.  To disable the action edit the watchlist name and remove the prefix.
